# Project Plan

## Title

Impact of CO2 emissions on the rise of temperature in India over the last decade.

## Main Question

Is there a statistically significant correlation between temperature and CO2 emissions in India during a specific time period?

## Description

This data engineering project aims to investigate the relationship between temperature and CO2 emissions in India during the last decade. Both temperature and CO2 emissions from industrial factories and vehichles are crucial factors that can significantly impact the environment and public health. Understanding their correlation can provide valuable insights about changes in CO2 emissions and how it affects temperatures in India.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Trends in global CO2 emissions
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains CO2 emissions data for India. It can be used for conducting statistical analyses, creating visualizations and generating insights to address the rising temperature problem in India. The data has been collected from OurWorldInData, licesenced as Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

### Datasource2: Temperatures in India
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india
* Data Type: CSV

Data consists of temperatures of India averaging the temperatures of all places. Temperatures values are recorded in celsius. The Data is of INDIAN GOVT. collected from the official Indian government website.

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Data Preparation: Sort, subset,remove unwanted data and arrange the rows and columns.
2. Data Integration: Compare the behaviour of datasets based on a common factor.
3. Data Analysis and visualisation: Analyse the behaviour of data and create visualizations to explore trends.
4. Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients, covariance and correlation matrices to determine the relationship between both datasets.
5. Drawing Conclusions: TODO:Present findings regarding the correlation between temperature and CO2 emissions in India.
