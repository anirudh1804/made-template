## Title

Exploring the correlation between Co2 emissions and temperatures in certain time period

## Main Question

Is there any correlation between Co2 emmissions and temperatures during a certain time period?

## Description

This data engineering project aims at analysing whether Co2 emmissions are correlated with temperature in India. In our analysis, we investigate the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and global temperatures over a set of years, using a common base of timeâ€”specifically, the year. Our examination comprises of using and combining visualizations and statistical measures to check for correlation between these two crucial variables.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Trends in global CO2 emissions
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains CO2 emissions data for India. It can be used for conducting statistical analyses, creating visualizations and generating insights to address the rising temperature problem in India. The data has been collected from OurWorldInData, licesenced as Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

### Datasource2: Temperatures in India
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india
* Data Type: CSV

Data consists of temperatures of India averaging the temperatures of all places. Temperatures values are recorded in celsius. The Data is of INDIAN GOVT. collected from the official Indian government website.
