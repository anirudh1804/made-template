# Project Plan

## Title

Impact of air pollution on the rise of temperature in India over the last decade.

## Main Question

Is there a statistically significant correlation between temperature and air quality in India during a specific time period?

## Description

This data engineering project aims to investigate the relationship between temperature and air quality in India during the last decade. Both temperature and air quality are crucial factors that can significantly impact the environment and public health. Understanding their correlation can provide valuable insights into how changes in temperature affect air quality in the Indian context.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Time Series Air Quality Data of India (2010-2023)
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisheksjha/time-series-air-quality-data-of-india-2010-2023
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisheksjha/time-series-air-quality-data-of-india-2010-2023/download?datasetVersionNumber=2
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains air quality data for Indian cities. It can be used for conducting statistical analyses, creating visualizations and generating insights to address the air pollution problems in India. The data has been collected from the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management, which indicates that it is a reliable and authoritative source

### Datasource2: Temperatures in India
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data Type: CSV

Data consists of temperatures of India averaging the temperatures of all places. Temperatures values are recorded in celsius. The Data is of INDIAN GOVT. collected from the official Indian government website.
